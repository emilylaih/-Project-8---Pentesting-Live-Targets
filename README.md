# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:

* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each color is vulnerable to only 2 of the 6 possible exploits. First discover which color has the specific vulnerability, then write a short description of how to exploit it, and finally demonstrate it using screenshots compiled into a GIF.

## Blue

Vulnerability #1:SQL Injection (SQLi)

Description: Perform SQL Injection attack on the website's address bar. ?id=' OR '1=1'#

Vulnerability #2:Session Hijacking/Fixation

Description:This example I used Session Fixation. The firefox webpage is the attack and the Microsoft Edge webpage is the target. First we get the attacker's session and copied it and replace the target's session. Then the target logged into the website and the attacker would be able to access the logged in website without inputting credentials.
